# University-Student-Database
A FreeCodeCamp relational database challenge
- In this challenge I build a database students. In this db, three tables are created: majors, courses, and students, and a junction table majors_courses.
The codes to rebuild the database are contained in **students.sql**.
- Then the bash script **insert_data.sh** is used to fill these tables from **.csv** files.
- Finally bash script **student_info.sh** is used to run few queries on students, their majors and their courses.
